#Virtual-Trial-Room

It is a virtual environment that utilizes the laptop camera to capture the user's image, which serves as an input. By employing face and body detection techniques, the video stream is analyzed to identify the presence of human faces, allowing product images such as dresses and face accessories to be accurately masked on to userâ€™s image

#Libraries

Pillow-The Pillow package is a popular Python library that provides support for manipulating and processing images.some common uses of the Pillow package are image processing,image filtering,image enhancement etc.

Pandas-The pandas package is a powerful and widely used Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions that make it easier to work with structured data, such as tabular data or time series data.

Seaborn-The seaborn library is a powerful data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, another popular visualization library in Python. Seaborn provides a higher-level interface and more aesthetically pleasing default styles compared to Matplotlib. Used for statistical analysis of data[provides functions to draw line plots,bar plot etc using which statistical analysis of the data can be done].

OpenCV-OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a popular open-source computer vision and image processing library.
